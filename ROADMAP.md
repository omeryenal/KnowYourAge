# ðŸ“… KnowYourAge Project Roadmap

A 50-day structured development plan to build, train, evaluate, and deploy a computer vision model that predicts a personâ€™s apparent age from webcam input.

---

## Week 1 â€“ Setup & Dataset

* **Day 01:** Project setup, virtual environment, download UTKFace dataset, plot age histogram
* **Day 02:** Write custom `UTKFaceDataset` class, test one sample
* **Day 03:** Implement baseline CNN (2 Conv + FC), train with MSELoss
* **Day 04:** Add train/val split, evaluate with MAE + show predicted vs. true age

---

## Week 2 â€“ Model Improvements & Checkpoints

* **Day 05:** Add 3rd Conv layer, Dropout, deeper architecture
* **Day 06:** Save best model with `torch.save()`
* **Day 07:** Reload model using `torch.load()` for inference
* **Day 08:** Add learning rate scheduler (ReduceLROnPlateau) & early stopping
* **Day 09:** Train for 20 epochs, compare Val MAE
* **Day 10:** Create a hold-out test set for final evaluation

---

## Week 3 â€“ Web API & Webcam Integration

* **Day 11:** Setup FastAPI app and `/predict` endpoint
* **Day 12:** Send image via POST and return predicted age
* **Day 13:** Use OpenCV to capture frames from webcam
* **Day 14:** Connect webcam to prediction API
* **Day 15:** Build minimal frontend (HTML/JS) with live webcam and result display

---

## Week 4 â€“ Metrics & Visualization

* **Day 16:** Plot Train vs Val Loss and MAE
* **Day 17:** Draw Predicted vs Actual Age scatter plot
* **Day 18:** Display sample predictions with image & predicted age
* **Day 19:** Evaluate model performance by age groups (bins)
* **Day 20:** Add interpretability: Grad-CAM or filter visualizations

---

## Week 5 â€“ Optimization & Alternatives

* **Day 21:** Convert model to TorchScript or ONNX
* **Day 22:** Create lightweight MobileNet-style version
* **Day 23:** Profile CPU vs GPU inference speed
* **Day 24:** Optional: Switch to PyTorch Lightning
* **Day 25:** Try alternative loss functions (Huber, SmoothL1)

---

## Week 6 â€“ Experiments & Regularization

* **Day 26:** Add data augmentation (transforms)
* **Day 27:** Normalize age labels (0â€“1 scale)
* **Day 28:** Try label smoothing
* **Day 29:** Implement model ensembling
* **Day 30:** Evaluate fairness: gender, lighting, ethnic bias

---

## Week 7 â€“ Deployment & Frontend Polish

* **Day 31:** Save final model in `.pt` and upload to cloud
* **Day 32:** Publish model on Hugging Face Hub (optional)
* **Day 33:** Improve frontend UI/UX and styling
* **Day 34:** Build Docker container for deployment
* **Day 35:** Build public demo with Streamlit or Gradio

---

## Week 8 â€“ Testing, Docs, Launch

* **Day 36:** Write unit tests for API and model loading
* **Day 37:** Finalize GitHub README with setup instructions
* **Day 38:** Record demo video for YouTube/LinkedIn
* **Day 39:** Post full project on LinkedIn with metrics
* **Day 40:** Wrap-up: summarize metrics & export report

---

## Bonus Days (Advanced)

* **Day 41â€“45:** Compare CNNs (ResNet, VGG)
* **Day 46â€“48:** Try landmark-based prediction (face keypoints)
* **Day 49:** Evaluate robustness (lighting, rotation, occlusion)
* **Day 50:** Publish portfolio, share on GitHub & personal site
